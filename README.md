# Selection-Sorting-in-C 👨‍💻

# Project Description
This repository contains a simple C implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm. The code is designed for educational purposes, providing a clear and straightforward example of how the algorithm works. It includes multiple source files, each demonstrating the sorting process on a predefined array.

# What is Selection Sort?
Selection Sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array:
  1.  The sorted subarray, which is built from the left.
  2.  The unsorted subarray, which contains the remaining elements.
The algorithm repeats the process of selecting the minimum element from the unsorted subarray and swapping it with the first element of the unsorted subarray until the entire array is sorted.

# How to Compile and Run
To compile and run the code, you'll need a C compiler (like GCC) installed on your system.

# 1. Compile
Navigate to the directory containing the source files and use the following command to compile any of the > .c files, for example, > A.c:

> gcc A.c -o A
>
This command compiles the A.c file and creates an executable file named A.

# 2. Run
After compiling, you can run the executable with the following command:

./A

This will execute the program and display the sorted array in the console.

# Files
The repository contains several C source files (A.c through J.c), each providing an example of the selection sort algorithm in action. All files implement the same core logic.

# Contribution
Feel free to fork the repository and experiment with the code. If you find any improvements or alternative implementations, a pull request is welcome!
